# p5-Sandbox

A collection of mini-projects that use p5.js to render visualizations and interactive demos based on random topics I find interesting. Each topic will have its own folder which will contain a `index.html`, `main.js`, and any other files needed for the project. `main.js` will contian the `setup()` and `draw()` functions that p5.js needs to run. p5.js will be linked via a CDN in `index.html`. As mentioned, classes and utility functions for the visualization/interactive demo will be included in each project folder. Given how each topic will be significantly different from one another, each project folder will contain a separate `README.md` file to describe the topic a bit.

# Goals

There is no end goal for this repo. I just want a place to store all these mini-project ideas that use p5.js. The topics will most certainly vary quite a bit.
