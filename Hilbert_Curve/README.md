# Hilbert Curve

## Description

This demo explores the topic of **Hilbert curves** and is based on these web pages:

    1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve

    2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve

The idea behind **space-filling-curves** is that given a unit of space, say a _unit square_, the technique will produce a curve with a _range_ (the _set_ of the curve's output values) that includes every point within the unit square. The Hilbert curve is an example of such a technique. The number of points within the unit square that the curve will pass through is denoted by the **order** of the Hilbert curve. A order-2 hilbert curve will have more points than the order-1, while the order-3 will have more than the order-2 hilbert curve, and so on. As the order size increases, the perception of individual points becomes difficult, until the curve appears to "fill" the entire unit square. Adding color to the curve as it progreses through the space gives the "illusion" of a continuous, colorized space.
